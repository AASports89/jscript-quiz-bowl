# Java$cript Quiz Bowl 

## APPLICATION OVERVIEW:

The Java$cript Quiz Bowl application features a user interactive game measuring aptitude against time via the classic quiz game setup with a technological twist. This application allows users to answer quiz formatted questions while the clock is running and a score tracking system is in play. Using a combination of the latest Javascript code along with HTML and CSS, the application is functional and fun at the same time. 

The user has the opportunity to answer javascript related questions in a certain amount of time, tracked by a visible timer. Each correct answer will increase the user's total score, however each wrong answer will reduce both the score and the time. Additionally, the user can log their final score using initials and retry the game as many times as they would like. Lastly, the menu features a 'Scores List' where the user is able to track their progress through each successive round of gameplay. 

Overall, this app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript while having mobile device capability.
